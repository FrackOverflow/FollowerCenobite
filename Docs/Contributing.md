# Contributing

***All contributions must be made in a seperate branch and submitted via pull request.*** Contibutions to FC are highly encouraged, it is a pet project so I won't be overly pedantic. If you have never made a contribution before this is a great place to learn the ropes. Pick a feature from the roadmap, or you can reach out to me by creating an issue on this repo and I can find something for you to work on.

To ensure your PR is merged make sure:
 - The PR description clearly describes feature
 - You follow the [style guide](https://github.com/FrackOverflow/FollowerCenobite/blob/main/Docs/Contributing/StyleGuide.md)
 - Your feature aligns with the goal of creating *an IG Superuser tool that will not get users banned/shadowbanned*! Remember: **FC is not a bot!**


 # Getting started

How to get started writing code for FC:
0. If you don't have it already, install the latest version of the Python v3.10 interpreter [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
1. Clone the repo.
2. Create a virtual environment with [venv](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/guides/installing-using-pip-and-virtual-environments/).
3. Open a terminal and activate the virtual environment.
4. Use pip to install the following packages to the virtual environment:
    - [CustomTkinter](https://pypi.org/project/customtkinter/) ([Docs](https://customtkinter.tomschimansky.com/documentation/))
    - [Pillow](https://pypi.org/project/pillow/)
    - [Flake8](https://pypi.org/project/flake8/) (Flake8 IDE extensions also work, config is in setup.cfg)
5. Create your own repo in a Fork of FC.
6. Work in your fork, when features are complete create Pull Requests back to the main repo.
